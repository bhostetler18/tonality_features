# tonality_features
A public place to track feature requests for Tonality.

You can view and add requests in the "Issues" tab. A feature request should be descriptive, clear, and cover only one general topic/request. You can reference other requests if necessary. Try to add tags that characterize the request (iOS, MIDI, guitar, etc).

If your request is related to an existing one, please add a comment rather than creating a new request.
